A method should always implement the contract of a method it overrides. Thus, if a method takes is annotated
as returning a @Nonnull value,
you shouldn't override that method in a subclass with a method annotated as returning a @Nullable or @CheckForNull value.
Doing so violates the contract that the method shouldn't return null.
