<p>
Calling <code>System.gc()</code> or <code>Runtime.getRuntime().gc()</code> is a bad idea for a simple reason:
there is no way to know exactly what will be done under the hood by the JVM because the behavior will depend on its vendor, version and options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will the whole application be frozen during the call?</li>
  <li>Is the -XX:DisableExplicitGC option activated?</li>
  <li>Will the JVM simply ignore the call?</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>An application relying on those unpredictable methods is also unpredictable and therefore broken.</p>

<p>The task of running the garbage collector should be left exclusively to the JVM.</p>
