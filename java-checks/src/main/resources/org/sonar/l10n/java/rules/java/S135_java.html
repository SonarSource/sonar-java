<p>Restricting the number of <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements in a loop is done in the interest of good structured
programming.</p>
<p>Only one <code>break</code> or one <code>continue</code> statement is acceptable in a loop, since it facilitates optimal coding. If there is more
than one, the code should be refactored to increase readability.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {     // Noncompliant - 2 continue - one might be tempted to add some logic in between
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    continue;
  }

  if (i % 3 == 0) {
    continue;
  }

  System.out.println("i = " + i);
}
</pre>
