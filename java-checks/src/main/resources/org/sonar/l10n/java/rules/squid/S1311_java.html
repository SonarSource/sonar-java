<p>The Cyclomatic Complexity is measured by the number of <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> operators and <code>if</code>,
<code>while</code>, <code>do</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>?:</code>, <code>catch</code>, <code>switch</code>, <code>case</code>,
<code>return</code> and <code>throw</code> statements in the body of a class plus one for each constructor, method, static initializer, or instance
initializer in the class. The last return statement in method, if exists, is not taken into account.</p>
<p>Even when the Cyclomatic Complexity of a class is very high, this complexity might be well distributed among all methods. Nevertheless, most of the
time, a very complex class is a class which breaks the Single Responsibility Principle and which should be re-factored to be split in several
classes.</p>
