<p>This rule template can be used to create rules which will be triggered when the full content of a comment matches a given regular expression. Note
that the regular expression should be expressed using the dotall format (where the <code>.</code> character matches any character).</p>
<p>For example, one can create a rule with the regular expression <code>.*REVIEW.*</code> to match all comment containing "REVIEW".</p>
<p>Note that, in order to match REVIEW regardless of the case, the <code>(?i)</code> modifier should be prepended to the expression, as in
<code>(?i).*REVIEW.*</code>.</p>
