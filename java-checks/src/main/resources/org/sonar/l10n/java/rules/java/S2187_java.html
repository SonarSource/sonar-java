<p>There's no point in having a JUnit <code>TestCase</code> without any test methods. Similarly, you shouldn't have a file in the tests directory with
"Test" in the name, but no tests in the file. Doing either of these things may lead someone to think that uncovered classes have been tested.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when files in the test directory have "Test" in the name or implement <code>TestCase</code> but don't contain any
tests.</p>
