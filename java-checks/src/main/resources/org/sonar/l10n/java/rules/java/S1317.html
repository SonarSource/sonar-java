<p>Instantiating a <code>StringBuilder</code> or a <code>StringBuffer</code> with a character is misleading because most Java developers would expect
the character to be the initial value of the <code>StringBuffer</code>.</p>
<p>What actually happens is that the int representation of the character is used to determine the initial size of the <code>StringBuffer</code>.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
StringBuffer foo = new StringBuffer('x');   //equivalent to StringBuffer foo = new StringBuffer(120);
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
StringBuffer foo = new StringBuffer("x");
</pre>
