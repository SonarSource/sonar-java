<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>When a <code>Serializable</code> object has a non-serializable ancestor in its inheritance chain, object deserialization (re-instantiating the
object from file) starts at the first non-serializable class, and proceeds down the chain, adding the properties of each subsequent child class, until
the final object has been instantiated.</p>
<p>In order to create the non-serializable ancestor, its no-argument constructor is called. Therefore the non-serializable ancestor of a
<code>Serializable</code> class must have a no-arg constructor. Otherwise the class is <code>Serializable</code> but not deserializable.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
public class Fruit {
  private Season ripe;

  public Fruit (Season ripe) {...}
  public void setRipe(Season ripe) {...}
  public Season getRipe() {...}
}

public class Raspberry extends Fruit
        implements Serializable {  // Noncompliant; nonserializable ancestor doesn't have no-arg constructor
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1;

  private String variety;

  public Raspberry(Season ripe, String variety) { ...}
  public void setVariety(String variety) {...}
  public String getVarity() {...}
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
public class Fruit {
  private Season ripe;

  public Fruit () {...};  // Compliant; no-arg constructor added to ancestor
  public Fruit (Season ripe) {...}
  public void setRipe(Season ripe) {...}
  public Season getRipe() {...}
}

public class Raspberry extends Fruit
        implements Serializable {
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1;

  private String variety;

  public Raspberry(Season ripe, String variety) {...}
  public void setVariety(String variety) {...}
  public String getVarity() {...}
}
</pre>
