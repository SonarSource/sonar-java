<p>When logging a message there are two important requirements which must be fulfilled:</p>
<ul>
<li> The user must be able to easily retrieve the logs</li>
<li> The format of all logged message must be uniform to allow the user to easily read the log</li>
</ul>
<p>If a program directly writes to the standard outputs, there is absolutely no way to comply with those requirements. That's why defining and using a dedicated logger is highly recommended.</p>
<p>The following code snippet illustrates this rule:</p>
<pre>
System.out.println("My Message");  //Non-Compliant

logger.log("My Message");          //Compliant
</pre>
