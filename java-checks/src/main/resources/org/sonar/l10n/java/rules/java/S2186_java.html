<p>JUnit assertions should not be made from the <code>run</code> method of a <code>Runnable</code>, because failed assertions result in
<code>AssertionError</code>s being thrown. If the error is thrown from a thread other than the one that ran the test, the thread will exit but the
test won’t fail.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public void run() {
  // ...
  Assert.assertEquals(expected, actual);  // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
