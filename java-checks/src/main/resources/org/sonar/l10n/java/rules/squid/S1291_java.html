<p>Any issue to quality rule can be deactivated with the <code>NOSONAR</code> marker. This marker is pretty useful to exclude false-positive results
but it can also be used abusively to hide real quality flaws.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when <code>NOSONAR</code> is used.</p>
<p>If option onlyWhenNoDetailsProvided is set, this rule only raises an isssue when <code>NOSONAR</code> is used alone with no further text on the comment line.<br/>
Enable this option if your policy is to allow usage of <code>NOSONAR</code> but require that the developer adds further comments explaining why.</p>
