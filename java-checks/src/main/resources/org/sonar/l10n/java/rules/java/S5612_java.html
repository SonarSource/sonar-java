<p>Lambdas (introduced with Java 8) are a very convenient and compact way to inject a behavior without having to create a dedicated class or method.
But those lambdas should be used only if the behavior to be injected can be defined in a few lines of code, otherwise the source code can quickly
become unreadable.</p>
