<p>An exception in a <code>throws</code> declaration in Java is superfluous if it is:</p>
<ul>
  <li> listed multiple times </li>
  <li> a subclass of another listed exception </li>
  <li> a <code>RuntimeException</code>, or one of its descendants </li>
  <li> completely unnecessary because the declared exception type cannot actually be thrown </li>
</ul>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
void foo() throws MyException, MyException {}  // Noncompliant; should be listed once
void bar() throws Throwable, Exception {}  // Noncompliant; Exception is a subclass of Throwable
void baz() throws RuntimeException {}  // Noncompliant; RuntimeException can always be thrown
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
void foo() throws MyException {}
void bar() throws Throwable {}
void baz() {}
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>In the case of an exception type that cannot be thrown from the method body, the rule will not raise any issue if the method is overridable
(non-final, or not member of a final class, non-static, non-private) and is documented with a proper javadoc.</p>
<pre>
class A extends B {
  /**
   * @throws IOException Overriding classes may throw this exception if they print values into a file
   */
  protected void print() throws IOException { // no issue, method is overridable and the exception type that is not thrown inside the body has proper javadoc
    System.out.println("foo");
  }
}
</pre>
