<p>In AWS, Long-term access keys will be valid until you manually revoke them. This makes them highly sensitive as any exposure can have serious
consequences and should be used with care.</p>
<p>This rule will trigger when encountering an instantiation of <code>com.amazonaws.auth.BasicAWSCredentials</code>.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The access key is used directly in an application or AWS CLI script running on an Amazon EC2 instance. </li>
  <li> Cross-account access is needed. </li>
  <li> The access keys need to be embedded within a mobile application. </li>
  <li> Existing identity providers (SAML 2.0, on-premises identity store) already exists. </li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html#use-roles">Use IAM roles
instead of Long-term access keys</a>.</p>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Consider using IAM roles or other features of the AWS Security Token Service that provide temporary credentials, limiting the risks.</p>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<pre>
import com.amazonaws.auth.AWSCredentials;
import com.amazonaws.auth.BasicAWSCredentials;
// ...

AWSCredentials awsCredentials = new BasicAWSCredentials(accessKeyId, secretAccessKey);
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>Example for AWS STS (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/prog-services-sts.html">Getting Temporary Credentials
with AWS STS</a>).</p>
<pre>
BasicSessionCredentials sessionCredentials = new BasicSessionCredentials(
   session_creds.getAccessKeyId(),
   session_creds.getSecretAccessKey(),
   session_creds.getSessionToken());
</pre>
