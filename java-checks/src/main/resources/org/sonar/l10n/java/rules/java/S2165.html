<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>There is no point in setting class fields to <code>null</code> in a finalizer. If this this is a hint to the garbage collector, it is unnecessary -
the object will be garbage collected anyway - and doing so may actually cause extra work for the garbage collector.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
public class Foo {
  private String name;

  @Override
  void finalize() {
    name = null;  // Noncompliant; completely unnecessary
  }
}
</pre>
