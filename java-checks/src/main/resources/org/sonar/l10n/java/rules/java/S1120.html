<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Proper indentation is a simple and effective way to improve the codeâ€™s readability. Consistent indentation among the developers within a team also
reduces the differences that are committed to source control systems, making code reviews easier.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when indentation does not match the configured value. Only the first line of a badly indented section is reported.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<p>With an indent size of 2:</p>
<pre>
class Foo {
  public int a;
   public int b;   // Noncompliant, expected to start at column 4

...

  public void doSomething() {
    if(something) {
          doSomethingElse();  // Noncompliant, expected to start at column 6
  }   // Noncompliant, expected to start at column 4
  }
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
class Foo {
  public int a;
  public int b;

...

  public void doSomething() {
    if(something) {
        doSomethingElse();
    }
  }
}
</pre>
