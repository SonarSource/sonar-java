<p>Tests should always:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Make sure that production code behaves as expected, including edge cases. </li>
  <li> Be easy to debug, i.e. understandable and reproducible. </li>
</ul>
<p>Using random values in tests will not necessarily check edge cases, and it will make test logs a lot harder to read. If you don't use a seed your
test will not be reproducible, and if you do use a seed there is no point in using random data. Use instead easily readable hardcoded values. If this
makes your code bigger you can use helper functions.</p>
<p>Note that there is one valid use cases for randomized data in tests: detect cases which you didn't think of. However when you do this you need to
be sure that you can retrieve the generated values and add new failing cases to the test suite. It is easier to do so with a property-based testing
library, such as <a href="https://github.com/jlink/jqwik">jqwik</a>.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when <code>new Random()</code> or <code>UUID.randomUUID()</code> are called in test code.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
int userAge = new Random().nextInt(42);  // Noncompliant
UUID userID = UUID.randomUUID(); // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
int userAge = 31;
UUID userID = UUID.fromString("00000000-000-0000-0000-000000000001");
</pre>
