<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>An exception in a <code>throws</code> declaration in Java is superfluous if it is:</p>
<ul>
  <li> listed multiple times </li>
  <li> a subclass of another listed exception </li>
  <li> completely unnecessary because the declared exception type cannot actually be thrown </li>
</ul>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
void foo() throws MyException, MyException {}  // Noncompliant; should be listed once
void bar() throws Throwable, Exception {}  // Noncompliant; Exception is a subclass of Throwable
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
void foo() throws MyException {}
void bar() throws Throwable {}
</pre>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The rule will not raise any issue for exceptions that cannot be thrown from the method body:</p>
<ul>
  <li> in overriding and implementation methods </li>
  <li> in interface <code>default</code> methods </li>
  <li> in non-private methods that only <code>throw</code>, have empty bodies, or a single return statement. </li>
  <li> in overridable methods (non-final, or not member of a final class, non-static, non-private), if the exception is documented with a proper
  JavaDoc </li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the rule won’t raise issues on <code>RuntimeException</code>, or one of its descendants, because explicating runtime exceptions which could
be thrown can ultimately help the method’s users, and can even be considered as good practice.</p>
