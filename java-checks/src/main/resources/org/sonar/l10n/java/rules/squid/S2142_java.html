<p><code>InterruptedExceptions</code> should never be ignored in the code, and simply logging the exception counts in this case as "ignoring". The
throwing of the <code>InterruptedException</code> clears the interrupted state of the Thread, so if the exception is not handled properly the fact
that the thread was interrupted will be lost. Instead, <code>InterruptedExceptions</code> should either be rethrown - immediately or after cleaning up
the method's state - or the thread should be re-interrupted by calling <code>Thread.interrupt()</code> even if this is supposed to be a
single-threaded application. Any other course of action risks delaying thread shutdown and loses the information that the thread was interrupted -
probably without finishing its task.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <code>ThreadDeath</code> exception should also be propagated. According to its JavaDoc:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If <code>ThreadDeath</code> is caught by a method, it is important that it be rethrown so that the thread actually dies.</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public void run () {
  try {
    while (true) {
      // do stuff
    }
  }catch (InterruptedException e) { // Noncompliant; logging is not enough
    LOGGER.log(Level.WARN, "Interrupted!", e);
  }
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public void run () {
  try {
    while (true) {
      // do stuff
    }
  }catch (InterruptedException e) {
    LOGGER.log(Level.WARN, "Interrupted!", e);
    // Restore interrupted state...
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
  }
}
</pre>
