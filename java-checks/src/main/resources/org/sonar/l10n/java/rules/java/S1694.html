<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The purpose of an abstract class is to provide some heritable behaviors while also defining methods which must be implemented by sub-classes.</p>
<p>A class with no abstract methods that was made abstract purely to prevent instantiation should be converted to a concrete class (i.e. remove the
<code>abstract</code> keyword) with a private constructor.</p>
<p>A class with only abstract methods and no inheritable behavior should be converted to an interface.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
public abstract class Animal {  // Noncompliant; should be an interface
  abstract void move();
  abstract void feed();
}

public abstract class Color {  // Noncompliant; should be concrete with a private constructor
  private int red = 0;
  private int green = 0;
  private int blue = 0;

  public int getRed() {
    return red;
  }
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
public interface Animal {
  void move();
  void feed();
}

public class Color {
  private int red = 0;
  private int green = 0;
  private int blue = 0;

  private Color () {}

  public int getRed() {
    return red;
  }
}

public abstract class Lamp {

  private boolean switchLamp=false;

  public abstract void glow();

  public void flipSwitch() {
    switchLamp = !switchLamp;
    if (switchLamp) {
      glow();
    }
  }
}
</pre>
