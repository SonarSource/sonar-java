<p>For most collections the <code>size()</code> method requires constant time, but the time required to execute
<code>ConcurrentLinkedQueue.size()</code> is directly proportional to the number of elements in the queue. When the queue is large, this could
therefore be an expensive operation. Further, the results may be inaccurate if the queue is modified during execution.</p>
<p>By the way, if the <code>size()</code> is used only to check that the collection is empty, then the <code>isEmpty()</code> method should be used.
</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
ConcurrentLinkedQueue queue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue();
//...
log.info("Queue contains " + queue.size() + " elements");
</pre>
