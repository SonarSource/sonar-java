<p>Java's garbage collection cannot be relied on to clean up everything. Specifically, connections, streams, files and other classes that implement the <code>Closeable</code> interface or it's super-interface, <code>AutoCloseable</code>, must be manually closed after creation. Failure to do so will result in a resource leak which could bring first the application and then perhaps the box it's on to their knees.</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>

<pre>
OutputStream stream = null;
try{
  for (String property : propertyList) {
    stream = new FileOutputStream("myfile.txt");  // Noncompliant
    // ...
  }
}catch(Exception e){
  // ...
}finally{
  stream.close();  // Multiple streams were opened. Only the last is closed.
}
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>

<pre>
OutputStream stream = null;
try{
  stream = new FileOutputStream("myfile.txt");
  for (String property : propertyList) {
    // ...
  }
}catch(Exception e){
  // ...
}finally{
  stream.close();
}
</pre>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>Java 7 introduced the try-with-resources statement, which implicitly closes <code>Closeables</code>. All resources opened in a try-with-resources statement are ignored by this rule.</p>

<pre>
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {
  //...
}
catch ( ... ) {
  //...
}
</pre>
