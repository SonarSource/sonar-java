Proper indentation is a simple and effective way to improve the code's readability.
Consistent indentation among developers also reduces the differences that are committed to source control systems, making code reviews easier.

<p>The following code illustrates this rule with an indentation level of 2:</p>

<pre>
class Foo {
  public int a; // Compliant
public int b;   // Non-Compliant
}
</pre>
