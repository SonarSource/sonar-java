<p><code>enum</code>s are generally thought of as constant, but an <code>enum</code> with a <code>public</code> field or <code>public</code> setter is
not only non-constant, but also vulnerable to malicious code. Ideally fields in an <code>enum</code> are <code>private</code> and set in the
constructor, but if that's not possible, their visibility should be reduced as much as possible.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public enum Continent {

  NORTH_AMERICA (23, 24709000),
  // ...
  EUROPE (50, 39310000);

  public int countryCount;  // Noncompliant
  private int landMass;

  Continent(int countryCount, int landMass) {
    // ...
  }

  public void setLandMass(int landMass) {  // Noncompliant
    this.landMass = landMass;
  }
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public enum Continent {

  NORTH_AMERICA (23, 24709000),
  // ...
  EUROPE (50, 39310000);

  private int countryCount;
  private int landMass;

  Continent(int countryCount, int landMass) {
    // ...
  }
</pre>
