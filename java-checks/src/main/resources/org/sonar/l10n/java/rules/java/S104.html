<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>A source file that grows too much tends to aggregate too many responsibilities and inevitably becomes harder to understand and, therefore, to
maintain.</p>
<p>Above a specific threshold, refactor the file into smaller files whose code focuses on well-defined tasks. Those smaller files will be easier to
understand and easier to test.</p>
