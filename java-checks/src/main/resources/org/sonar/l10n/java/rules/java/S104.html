<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>When a source file grows too much, it can accumulate numerous responsibilities and become challenging to understand and maintain.</p>
<p>Above a specific threshold, refactor the file into smaller files whose code focuses on well-defined tasks. Those smaller files will be easier to
understand and test.</p>
