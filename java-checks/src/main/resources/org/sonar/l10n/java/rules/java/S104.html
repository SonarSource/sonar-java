<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>A source file that grows too much tends to aggregate too many responsibilities and inevitably becomes harder to understand and therefore to
maintain. Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor it into smaller pieces of code which focus on well defined tasks. Those
smaller files will not only be easier to understand but also probably easier to test.</p>
