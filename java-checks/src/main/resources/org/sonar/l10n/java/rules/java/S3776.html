<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Cognitive Complexity is a measure of how hard the control flow of a method is to understand. Methods with high Cognitive Complexity will be
difficult to maintain.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p><code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> methods are ignored because they might be automatically generated and might end up being difficult to
understand, especially in the presence of many fields.</p>
