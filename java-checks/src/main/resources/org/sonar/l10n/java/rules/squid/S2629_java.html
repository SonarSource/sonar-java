<p>Passing message arguments that require further evaluation into a Guava <code>com.google.common.base.Preconditions</code> check can result in a
performance penalty. That's because whether or not they're needed, each argument must be resolved before the method is actually called.</p>
<p>Similarly, passing concatenated strings into a logging method can also incur a needless performance hit because the concatenation will be performed
every time the method is called, whether or not the log level is low enough to show the message.</p>
<p>Instead, you should structure your code to pass static or pre-computed values into <code>Preconditions</code> conditions check and logging
calls.</p>
<p>Specifically, the built-in string formatting should be used instead of string concatenation, and if the message is the result of a method call,
then <code>Preconditions</code> should be skipped altoghether, and the relevant exception should be conditionally thrown instead.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
logger.log(Level.DEBUG, "Something went wrong: " + message);  // Noncompliant; string concatenation performed even when log level too high to show DEBUG messages

logger.fine("An exception occurred with message: " + message); // Noncompliant

LOG.error("Unable to open file " + csvPath, e);  // Noncompliant

Preconditions.checkState(a &gt; 0, "Arg must be positive, but got " + a);  // Noncompliant. String concatenation performed even when a &gt; 0

Preconditions.checkState(condition, formatMessage());  // Noncompliant. formatMessage() invoked regardless of condition

Preconditions.checkState(condition, "message: %s", formatMessage());  // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
logger.log(Level.SEVERE, "Something went wrong: {0} ", message);  // String formatting only applied if needed

logger.fine("An exception occurred with message: {}", message);  // SLF4J, Log4j

logger.log(Level.SEVERE, () -&gt; "Something went wrong: " + message); // since Java 8, we can use Supplier , which will be evaluated lazily

LOG.error("Unable to open file {0}", csvPath, e);

if (LOG.isDebugEnabled() {
  LOG.debug("Unable to open file " + csvPath, e);  // this is compliant, because it will not evaluate if log level is above debug.
}

Preconditions.checkState(arg &gt; 0, "Arg must be positive, but got %d", a);  // String formatting only applied if needed

if (!condition) {
  throw new IllegalStateException(formatMessage());  // formatMessage() only invoked conditionally
}

if (!condition) {
  throw new IllegalStateException("message: " + formatMessage());
}
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p><code>catch</code> blocks are ignored, because the performance penalty is unimportant on exceptional paths (catch block should not be a part of
standard program flow). Getters are ignored as well as methods called on annotations which can be considered as getters. This rule accounts for
explicit test-level testing with SLF4J methods <code>isXXXEnabled</code> and ignores the bodies of such <code>if</code> statements.</p>
