<p>If <code>Thread.sleep(...)</code> is called when the current thread holds a lock, it could lead to performance, and scalability issues, or even worse to deadlocks because the execution of the thread holding the lock is frozen. It's better to call <code>wait(...)</code> on the monitor object to temporarily release the lock and allow other threads to run.</p>

<pre>
public void doSomething(){
  synchronized(monitor) {
    while(notReady()){
      monitor.wait(200);
    }
    process();
  }
  ...
}
</pre>
