<p>Deserializing objects is security-sensitive. For example, it has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10654">CVE-2018-10654</a>: Hazelcast Library: Java deserialization
  vulnerability </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000058">CVE-2018-1000058</a>: Jenkins Pipeline: arbitrary code execution
  vulnerability </li>
</ul>
<p>Object deserialization from an untrusted source can lead to unexpected code execution. <code>ObjectInputStream</code> doesn't provide a way to
apply rules on its <code>InputStream</code> argument. Knowing that all serializable classes in the scope of the classloader will be deserialized,
there is a possibility that malicious code could be executed during the deserialization phase even if, in the end, a <code>ClassCastException</code>
will be raised.</p>
<p>Deserialization takes a stream of bits and turns it into an object. If the stream contains the type of object you expect, all is well. But if
you're deserializing untrusted input, and an attacker has inserted some other type of object, you're in trouble. Why? There are a few different attack
scenarios, but one widely-documented one goes like this: Deserialization first instantiates an <code>Object</code>, then uses the
<code>readObject</code> method to populate it. If the attacker has overridden <code>readObject</code> then he is entirely in control of what code
executes during that process. It is only after <code>readObject</code> has completed that your newly-minted <code>Object</code> can be cast to the
type you expected. A <code>ClassCastException</code> or <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> will be thrown, but at that point it's too late.</p>
