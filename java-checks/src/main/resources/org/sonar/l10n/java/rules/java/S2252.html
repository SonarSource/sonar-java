<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>If a <code>for</code> loopâ€™s condition is false before the first loop iteration, the loop will never be executed. Such loops are almost always
bugs, particularly when the initial value and stop conditions are hard-coded.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
for (int i = 10; i &lt; 10; i++) {  // Noncompliant
  // ...
</pre>
