<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Simply implementing <code>Cloneable</code> without also overriding <code>Object.clone()</code> does not necessarily make the class cloneable. While
the <code>Cloneable</code> interface does not include a <code>clone</code> method, it is required by convention, and ensures true cloneability.
Otherwise the default JVM <code>clone</code> will be used, which copies primitive values and object references from the source to the target. I.e.
without overriding <code>clone</code>, any cloned instances will potentially share members with the source instance.</p>
<p>Removing the <code>Cloneable</code> implementation and providing a good copy constructor is another viable (some say preferable) way of allowing a
class to be copied.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
class Team implements Cloneable {  // Noncompliant
  private Person coach;
  private List&lt;Person&gt; players;
  public void addPlayer(Person p) {...}
  public Person getCoach() {...}
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
class Team implements Cloneable {
  private Person coach;
  private List&lt;Person&gt; players;
  public void addPlayer(Person p) { ... }
  public Person getCoach() { ... }

  @Override
  public Object clone() {
    Team clone = (Team) super.clone();
    //...
  }
}
</pre>
