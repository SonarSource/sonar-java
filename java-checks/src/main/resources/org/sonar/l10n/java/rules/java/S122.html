<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Putting multiple statements on a single line lowers the code readability and makes debugging the code more complex.</p>
<pre>
if (someCondition) doSomething(); // Noncompliant
</pre>
<p>Write one statement per line to improve readability.</p>
<pre>
if (someCondition) {
  doSomething();
}
</pre>
