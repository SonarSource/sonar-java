<p>Importing all classes from a package or static members from a class leads to tight coupling between packages or classes and might lead to problems when a new version of a library introduces name clashes.</p>
<p>The following code:</p>
<pre>
import java.util.*;  // Non-Compliant
</pre>
<p>should be refactored into:</p>
<pre>
import java.util.List;  // Compliant
</pre>
