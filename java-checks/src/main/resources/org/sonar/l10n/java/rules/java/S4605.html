<p>Spring beans belonging to packages that are not included in a <code>@ComponentScan</code> configuration will not be accessible in the Spring
Application Context. Therefore, it’s likely to be a configuration mistake that will be detected by this rule.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the <code>@ComponentScan</code> is implicit in the <code>@SpringBootApplication</code> annotation, case in which Spring Boot
will auto scan for components in the package containing the Spring Boot main class and its sub-packages.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
package com.mycompany.app;

@Configuration
@ComponentScan("com.mycompany.app.beans")
public class Application {
...
}

package com.mycompany.app.web;

@Controller
public class MyController { // Noncompliant; MyController belong to "com.mycompany.app.web" while the ComponentScan is looking for beans in "com.mycompany.app.beans" package
...
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
package com.mycompany.app;

@Configuration
@ComponentScan({"com.mycompany.app.beans","com.mycompany.app.web"})
or
@ComponentScan("com.mycompany.app")
or
@ComponentScan
public class Application {
...
}

package com.mycompany.app.web;

@Controller
public class MyController { // "com.mycompany.app.web" is referenced by a @ComponentScan annotated class
...
}
</pre>
