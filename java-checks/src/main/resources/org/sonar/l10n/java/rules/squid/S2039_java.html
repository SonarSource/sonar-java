<p>Failing to explicitly declare the visibility of a member variable could result it in having a visibility you don't expect, and potentially leave it open to unexpected modification by other classes. </p>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
class Ball {
    private String color="red";  // Compliant
}
enum A {
  B;
  private int a;
}
</pre>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>Using Guava's <code>@VisibleForTesting</code> annotation. This annotation indicates that the visibility of a type or member has been purposely relaxed to make the code testable.</p>

<pre>
class Cone {
  @VisibleForTesting
  Logger logger; // Compliant
}
</pre>
