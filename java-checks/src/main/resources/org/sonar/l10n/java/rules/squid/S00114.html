<p>Sharing some naming conventions is a key point to make it possible for a team to efficiently collaborate. This rule allows to check that all interface names match a provided regular expression.</p>

<pre>
public interface MyFirstInterface {...} // Compliant
public interface mySecondInterface {...} // Non-Compliant
</pre>
