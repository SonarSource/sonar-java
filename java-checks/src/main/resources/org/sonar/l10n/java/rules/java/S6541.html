<p>Methods should not perform too many tasks (Brain method)</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>This issue is often referred as 'Brain method' anti-pattern.<br> A brain method is a method that tends to centralize its owner class logic and
generally performs too many operations, checks too many conditions, and uses lots of variables, making it diffucult to understand, maintain and
reuse.<br> It is characterized by high LOC number, high cyclomatic and cognitive complexity, and a large number of variables being used.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Brain methods are often hard to cover with tests, because of their deep nesting, and their are error prone, because of the many local variables
they usually present.<br> Such methods will be very hard to read and understand for anyone outside who created them, and therefore hard to maintain
and fix if bugs get spotted.<br> Also they make it easier to have duplicated code since the method itself is hardly going to be reused anywhere
else.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>The common approach is to identify fragments of the methodâ€™s code that deal with a specific responsibility and extract them to a new method. This
will make each method more readable, easy to understand and maintain, easier to test, and more prone to be reused.</p>

<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre>
void farmDailyRoutine() {
    Crops southEastCrops = getCrops(1, -1);
    Crops eastCrops = getCrops(1, 0);
    WaterContainer waterContainer = new WaterContainer();
    List&lt;Bottle&gt; bottles = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
      var bottle = new Bottle();
      bottle.addWater(10L);
      bottle.putCap();
      bottle.shake(2);
      bottles.add(bottle);
    }
    waterContainer.store(bottles);

    Truck t1 = new Truck(Truck.Type.TRANSPORT);
    t1.load(waterContainer);
    if(Weather.current != Weather.RAINY) {
      WaterContainer extraWaterContainer = new WaterContainer();
      List&lt;Bottle&gt; extraBottles = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
      if(southEastCrops.isDry()) {
        for(LandSlot ls : southEastCrops.lands()) {
          Bottle b = new Bottle();
          b.addWater(10L);
          b.putCap();
          extraBottles.add(b);
        }
      }else {
        extraBottles.add(new Bottle());
      }
      if(eastCrops.isDry()) {
        for(LandSlot ls : southEastCrops.lands()) {
          Bottle b = new Bottle();
          b.addWater(10L);
          b.putCap();
          extraBottles.add(b);
        }
      }else {
        extraBottles.add(new Bottle());
      }
      extraWaterContainer.store(extraBottles);
      t1.load(extraWaterContainer);
    }else {
      WaterContainer extraWaterContainer = WaterSource.clone(waterContainer);
      t1.load(extraWaterContainer)
    }
  }
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre>
void farmDailyRoutine() {
    Crops southEastCrops = getCrops(1, -1);
    Crops eastCrops = getCrops(1, 0);
    WaterContainer waterContainer = new WaterContainer();
    List&lt;Bottle&gt; bottles = getWaterBottles(10, 10L, true);
    waterContainer.store(bottles);

    Truck t1 = new Truck(Truck.Type.TRANSPORT);
    t1.load(waterContainer);
    if(Weather.current != Weather.RAINY) {
      WaterContainer extraWaterContainer = new WaterContainer();
      fillContainerForCrops(extraWaterContainer, southEastCrops);
      fillContainerForCrops(extraWaterContainer, eastCrops);
      t1.load(extraWaterContainer);
    }else {
      WaterContainer extraWaterContainer = WaterSource.clone(waterContainer);
      t1.load(extraWaterContainer)
    }
  }

  private fillContainerForCrops(WaterContainer wc, Crops crops) {
    if(crops.isDry()) {
      wc.store(getWaterBottles(crops.lands().size(), 10L, false));
    }else {
      wc.store(Collections.singleton(new Bottle()));
    }
  }

  private List&lt;Bottle&gt; getWaterBottles(int qt, long liquid, boolean shake){
    List&lt;Bottle&gt; bottles = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; qt; i++) {
      Bottle b = new Bottle();
      b.addWater(liquid);
      b.putCap();
      if(shake) {
        b.shake();
      }
      bottles.add(b);
    }
    return bottles;
  }
</pre>
<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>In this case, the method <code>farmDailyRoutine</code> was taking care of performing many different tasks, with nested conditions and loops, it was
long and plenty of local variables. By separating its logic into multiple single responsibility methods, it is reusing parts of its original
duplicated code and each of the new methods are now readable and easy to understand. They are also easier to cover with tests, and many other parts of
the owner class could benefit by using these methods now.</p>
