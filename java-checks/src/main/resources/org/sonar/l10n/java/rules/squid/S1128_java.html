<p>The imports part of a file should be handled by the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), not manually by the developer. </p>
<p>Unused and useless imports should not occur if that is the case. </p>
<p>Leaving them in reduces the code's readability, since their presence can be confusing.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
package my.company;

import java.lang.String;        // Noncompliant; java.lang classes are always implicitly imported
import my.company.SomeClass;    // Noncompliant; same-package files are always implicitly imported
import java.io.File;            // Noncompliant; File is not used

import my.company2.SomeType;
import my.company2.SomeType;    // Noncompliant; 'SomeType' is already imported

class ExampleClass {

  public String someString;
  public SomeType something;

}
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Imports for types mentioned in comments, such as Javadocs, are ignored.</p>
