<p>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities occur when attackers can trick a user to perform sensitive authenticated operations on a web
application without his consent.</p>
<p>Imagine a web application where an authenticated user can do actions like changing his email address and which has no CSRF protection. A malicious
website could forge a web page form to send the HTTP request that change the user email. When the user visits the malicious web page, the form is
automatically submitted in his name and his account email is changed to an arbitrary email.</p>
<p>Such an attack is only possible if the web browser automatically sends authentication information to the trusted domain (e.g cookie based
authentication) </p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The web application uses cookies to authenticate users. </li>
  <li> There exist sensitive operations in the web application that can be performed when the user is authenticated. </li>
  <li> The state / resources of the web application can be modified by doing HTTP POST or HTTP DELETE requests for example. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Protection against CSRF attacks is strongly recommended:
    <ul>
      <li> to be activated by default for all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Safe_methods">unsafe HTTP
      methods</a>. </li>
      <li> implemented, for example, with an unguessable CSRF token </li>
    </ul> </li>
  <li> Of course all sensitive operations should not be performed with <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Safe_methods">safe HTTP</a> methods like <code>GET</code> which are designed to be
  used only for information retrieval. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.0.CI-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/csrf.html">Spring Security</a> provides by default a
protection against CSRF attacks.</p>
<pre>
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.csrf().disable(); // Sensitive
  }
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>With <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.0.CI-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/csrf.html">Spring Security CSRF protection</a> is
enabled by default, do not disable it.</p>
<pre>
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    // http.csrf().disable(); // Compliant
  }
}
</pre>
