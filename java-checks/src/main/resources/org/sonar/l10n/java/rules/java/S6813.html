<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Dependency injection frameworks such as Spring support dependency injection by using annotations such as <code>@Inject</code> and
<code>@Autowired</code>. These annotation can be used to inject beans via constructor, setter, and field injection.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, field injection is discouraged. It allows the creation of objects in an invalid state and makes testing more difficult. The
dependencies are not explicit when instantiating a class that uses field injection.</p>
<p>Apart from that, field injection is not compatible with final fields. Keeping dependencies immutable where possible makes the code easier to
understand, easing development and maintenance.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when the <code>@Autowired</code> or <code>@Inject</code> annotations are used on a field.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Use constructor injection instead.</p>
<p>By using constructor injection, the dependencies are explicit and must be passed during an object’s construction. This avoids the possibility of
instantiating an object in an invalid state and makes types more testable. Fields can be declared final, which makes the code easier to understand, as
dependencies don’t change after instantiation.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
public class SomeService {
    @Autowired
    private SomeDependency someDependency;
}
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
public class SomeService {
    private final SomeDependency someDependency;

    @Autowired
    public SomeService(SomeDependency someDependency) {
        this.someDependency = someDependency;
    }
}
</pre>
