<p>Assignments within sub-expressions are hard to spot and therefore make the code less readable.</p>
<p>It is also a common mistake to write <code>=</code> when <code>==</code> was meant.</p>
<p>Ideally, expressions should not have side-effects.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>

<pre>
doSomething(i = 42);
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>

<pre>
i = 42;
doSomething(i);   
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
doSomething(i == 42);  // Perhaps in fact the assignment operator was expected
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>Assignments in <code>while</code> statement conditions, and assignments enclosed in relational expressions are allowed.</p>
