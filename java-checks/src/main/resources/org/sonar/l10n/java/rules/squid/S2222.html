<p>The logic in a method should ensure that locks are released in the methods in which they were acquired. Failure to release a lock increases the potential for deadlocks and could result in runtime errors in production.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>

<pre>
public class MyClass {
  Lock lock = new Lock();

  public void acquireLock() {
    lock.lock();  // Noncompliant;
  }

  public void releaseLock() {
    lock.unlock();
  }

  public void doTheThing() {
    acquireLock();
    // do work...
    releaseLock();
  }

  public void doTheOtherThing() {
    try {
      lock.tryLock();  // Noncompliant
      // do work...
      lock.unlock(); // an exception could keep this line from being reached
    } catch (ExceptionType e) {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>

<pre>
public class MyClass {
  Lock lock = new Lock();

  public void doTheThing() {
    lock.lock();
    // do work...
    lock.unlock();
  }

  public void doTheOtherThing() {
    try {
      lock.tryLock();
      // do work...
    } catch (ExceptionType e) {
      // ...
    } finally {
      lock.unlock();
    }
  }
}
</pre>
