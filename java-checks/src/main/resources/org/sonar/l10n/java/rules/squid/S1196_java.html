<p>When several packages are involved in a cycle (package A &gt; package B &gt; package C &gt; package A, where "&gt;" means "depends upon"), that
means those packages are highly coupled, and there is no way to reuse/extract one of those packages without importing all the other packages. Such
cycle could quickly increase the effort required to maintain an application and embrace business change. </p>
<p>SonarQube not only detect cycles between packages, but also calculates the minimum effort to break those cycles. This rule logs a violation on each
source file having an outgoing dependency to be cut in order to break a cycle.</p>
