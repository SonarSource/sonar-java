<p>Empty statements, i.e. <code>;</code>, are usually introduced by mistake, for example because:</p>
<ul>
  <li> It was meant to be replaced by an actual statement, but this was forgotten. </li>
  <li> There was a typo which lead the semicolon to be doubled, i.e. <code>;;</code>. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
void doSomething() {
  ;                                                       // Noncompliant - was used as a kind of TODO marker
}

void doSomethingElse() {
  System.out.println("Hello, world!");;                     // Noncompliant - double ;
  ...
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
void doSomething() {}

void doSomethingElse() {
  System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  ...
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) ; // compliant if unique statement of a loop
  ...
}
</pre>
