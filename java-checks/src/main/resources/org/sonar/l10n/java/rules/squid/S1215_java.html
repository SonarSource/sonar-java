<p>Calling <code>System.gc()</code> or <code>Runtime.getRuntime().gc()</code> is a bad idea for a simple reason: there is no way to know exactly what
will be done under the hood by the JVM because the behavior will depend on its vendor, version and options:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Will the whole application be frozen during the call? </li>
  <li> Is the <code>-XX:DisableExplicitGC</code> option activated? </li>
  <li> Will the JVM simply ignore the call? </li>
  <li> ... </li>
</ul>
<p>An application relying on these unpredictable methods is also unpredictable and therefore broken. The task of running the garbage collector should
be left exclusively to the JVM.</p>
