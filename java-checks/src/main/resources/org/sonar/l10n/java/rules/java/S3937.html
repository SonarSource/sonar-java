<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The use of punctuation characters to separate subgroups in a number can make the number more readable. For instance consider 1,000,000,000 versus
1000000000. But when the grouping is irregular, such as 1,000,00,000; it indicates an error.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when underscores (<code>_</code>) are used to break a number into irregular subgroups.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
int thousand = 100_0;
int tenThousand = 100_00;
int million = 1_000_00_000;
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
int thousand = 1000;
int tenThousand = 10_000;
int tenThousandWithout = 10000;
int duos = 1_00_00;
int million = 100_000_000;
</pre>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>No issue will be raised on binary numbers (starting with <code>0b</code> or <code>0B</code>). Binary number bits are often grouped corresponding to
certain meanings, resulting in irregular bit group sizes.</p>
<pre>
int configValue1 = 0b00_000_10_1; // Compliant
int configValue2 = 0B00_000_10_1; // Compliant
</pre>
