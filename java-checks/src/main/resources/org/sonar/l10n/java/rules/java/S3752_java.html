<p>An HTTP method is safe when used to perform a read-only operation, such as retrieving information. In contrast, an unsafe HTTP method is used to
change the state of an application, for instance to update a userâ€™s profile on a web application.</p>
<p>Common safe HTTP methods are GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS.</p>
<p>Common unsafe HTTP methods are POST, PUT and DELETE.</p>
<p>Allowing both safe and unsafe HTTP methods to perform a specific operation on a web application could impact its security, for example CSRF
protections are most of the time only protecting operations performed by unsafe HTTP methods.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> HTTP methods are not defined at all for a route/controller of the application. </li>
  <li> Safe HTTP methods are defined and used for a route/controller that can change the state of an application. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>For all the routes/controllers of an application, the authorized HTTP methods should be explicitly defined and safe HTTP methods should only be
used to perform read-only operations.</p>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<pre>
@RequestMapping("/delete_user")  // Sensitive: by default all HTTP methods are allowed
public String delete1(String username) {
// state of the application will be changed here
}

@RequestMapping(path = "/delete_user", method = {RequestMethod.GET, RequestMethod.POST}) // Sensitive: both safe and unsafe methods are allowed
String delete2(@RequestParam("id") String id) {
// state of the application will be changed here
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
@RequestMapping("/delete_user", method = RequestMethod.POST)  // Compliant
public String delete1(String username) {
// state of the application will be changed here
}

@RequestMapping(path = "/delete_user", method = RequestMethod.POST) // Compliant
String delete2(@RequestParam("id") String id) {
// state of the application will be changed here
}
</pre>
