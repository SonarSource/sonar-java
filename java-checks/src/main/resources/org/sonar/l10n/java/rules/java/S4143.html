<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Storing a value inside a collection at a given key or index and then unconditionally overwriting it without reading the initial value is a case of
"dead store".</p>
<pre>
letters.put("a", "Apple");
letters.put("a", "Boy");  // Noncompliant

towns[i] = "London";
towns[i] = "Chicago";  // Noncompliant
</pre>
<p>At best it is redundant and will confuse the reader, most often it is an error and not what the developer intended to do.</p>
