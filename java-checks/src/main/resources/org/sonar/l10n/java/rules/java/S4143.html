<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>It is highly suspicious when a value is saved for a key or index and then unconditionally overwritten. Such replacements are likely errors.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
letters.put("a", "Apple");
letters.put("a", "Boy");  // Noncompliant

towns[i] = "London";
towns[i] = "Chicago";  // Noncompliant
</pre>
