<p>There is no good excuse for an empty class. If it’s being used simply as a common extension point, it should be replaced with an
<code>interface</code>. If it was stubbed in as a placeholder for future development it should be fleshed-out. In any other case, it should be
eliminated.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public class Nothing {  // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public interface Nothing {
}
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Empty classes can be used as marker types (for Spring for instance), therefore empty classes that are annotated will be ignored.</p>
<pre>
@Configuration
@EnableWebMvc
public final class ApplicationConfiguration {

}
</pre>
