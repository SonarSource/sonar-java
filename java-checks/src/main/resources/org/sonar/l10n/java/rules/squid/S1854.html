<p>A dead store happens when a local variable is assigned a value, including <code>null</code> that is not read by any subsequent instruction. Calculating or retrieving a value only to then overwrite it or throw it away, could indicate a serious error in the code. Even if it's not an error, it is at best a waste of resources.</p>

<p>Even assigning <code>null</code> to a variable is a dead store if the variable is not subsequently used. Assigning null as a hint to the garbage collector used to be common practice, but is no longer needed and such code should be eliminated.</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public void pow(int a, int b) {
  if(b == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  int x = a;
  for(int i= 1, i < b, i++) {
    x = x * a;  //Dead store because the last return statement should return x instead of returning a
  }
  return a;
}
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public void pow(int a, int b) {
  if(b == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  int x = a;
  for(int i= 1, i < b, i++) {
    x = x * a;
  }
  return x;
}
</pre>
