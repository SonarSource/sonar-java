<p><code>Double.longBitsToDouble</code> expects a 64-bit, <code>long</code> argument. Pass it a smaller value, such as an <code>int</code> and the
mathematical conversion into a <code>double</code> simply won't work as anticipated because the layout of the bits will be interpreted incorrectly, as
if a child were trying to use an adult's gloves.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
int i = 42;
double d = Double.longBitsToDouble(i);  // Noncompliant
</pre>
