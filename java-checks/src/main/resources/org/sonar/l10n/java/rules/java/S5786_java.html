<p>JUnit5 is more tolerant regarding the visibilities of Test classes than JUnit4, which required everything to be \<code>public</code>.</p>
<p>In this context, JUnit5 test classes can have any visibility but <code>private</code>, however, it is recommended to use the default package
visibility, which improves readability of code.</p>
<p>Similarly, simply annotating a method with <code>@Test</code> is not enough to make it executed as a test, it also needs adequate
visibility.&nbsp;With JUnit5, while technically a test method can be anything but <code>private</code>&nbsp;to be executed, it is recommended to not
add any modifiers and let it with the default package visibility, for simplicity. However, note that a private test method is systematically ignored,
without proper warning.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class MyClassTest { // Noncompliant
  @Test
  protected void test() { // Noncompliant - modifier can be removed
    // ...
  }
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class MyClassTest {
  @Test
  void test() {
    // ...
  }
}
</pre>
