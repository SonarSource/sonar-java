<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Java Collections API is to provide a well defined hierarchy of interfaces in order to hide implementation details.</p>
<p>Implementing classes must be used to instantiate new collections, but the result of an instantiation should ideally be stored in a variable whose
type is a Java Collection interface.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when an implementation class:</p>
<ul>
  <li> is returned from a <code>public</code> method. </li>
  <li> is accepted as an argument to a <code>public</code> method. </li>
  <li> is exposed as a <code>public</code> member. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
public class Employees {
  private HashSet&lt;Employee&gt; employees = new HashSet&lt;Employee&gt;();  // Noncompliant - "employees" should have type "Set" rather than "HashSet"

  public HashSet&lt;Employee&gt; getEmployees() {                       // Noncompliant
    return employees;
  }
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
public class Employees {
  private Set&lt;Employee&gt; employees = new HashSet&lt;Employee&gt;();      // Compliant

  public Set&lt;Employee&gt; getEmployees() {                           // Compliant
    return employees;
  }
}
</pre>
