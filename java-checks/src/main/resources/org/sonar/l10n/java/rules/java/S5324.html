<p>Storing data locally is a common task for mobile applications. Such data includes files among other things. One convenient way to store files is to
use the external file storage which usually offers a larger amount of disc space compared to internal storage.</p>
<p>Files created on the external storage are globally readable and writable. Therefore, a malicious application having the permissions
<code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> or <code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> could try to read sensitive information from the files that other
applications have stored on the external storage.</p>
<p>External storage can also be removed by the user (e.g when based on SD card) making the files unavailable to the application.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<p>Your application uses external storage to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> store files that contain sensitive data. </li>
  <li> store files that are not meant to be shared with other application. </li>
  <li> store files that are critical for the application to work. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Use internal storage whenever possible as the system prevents other apps from accessing this location. </li>
  <li> Only use external storage if you need to share non-sensitive files with other applications. </li>
  <li> If your application has to use the external storage to store sensitive data, make sure it encrypts the files using <a
  href="https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/security/crypto/EncryptedFile">EncryptedFile</a>. </li>
  <li> Data coming from external storage should always be considered untrusted and should be validated. </li>
  <li> As some external storage can be removed, make sure to never store files on it that are critical for the usability of your application. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<pre>
import android.content.Context;

public class AccessExternalFiles {

    public void accessFiles(Context context) {
        context.getExternalFilesDir(null); // Sensitive
    }
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
import android.content.Context;

public class AccessExternalFiles {

    public void accessFiles(Context context) {
        context.getFilesDir();
    }
}
</pre>
