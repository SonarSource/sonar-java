<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Anonymous classes are a very convenient and compact way to inject a behavior without having to create a dedicated class. But those anonymous inner
classes should be used only if the behavior to be injected can be defined in a few lines of code, otherwise the source code can quickly become
unreadable.</p>
