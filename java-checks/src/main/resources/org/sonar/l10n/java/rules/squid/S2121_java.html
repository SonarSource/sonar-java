<p>Creating a substring from 0 to the end is silly. You'll end up with the same string you started with. Using the value of <code>String.length</code>
as either the start or end of a substring has similarly predictable results.</p>
<p>Calling <code>String.contains</code> with the argument being identical to the String on which contains is invoked doesn't make sense.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
String speech = "Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their country.";

String s1 = speech.substring(0); // Noncompliant. Yields the whole string
String s2 = speech.substring(speech.length()); // Noncompliant. Yields "";
String s3 = speech.substring(5,speech.length()); // Noncompliant. Use the 1-arg version instead

if (speech.contains(speech)) { // Noncompliant
 // always true
} {code}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
String speech = "Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their country.";

String s1 = speech;
String s2 = "";
String s3 = speech.substring(5);
</pre>
