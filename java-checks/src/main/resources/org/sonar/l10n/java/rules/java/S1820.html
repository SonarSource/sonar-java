<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>A class that grows too much tends to aggregate too many responsibilities and inevitably becomes harder to understand and therefore to maintain, and
having a lot of fields is an indication that a class has grown too large.</p>
<p>Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor the class into smaller ones which focus on well defined topics.</p>
