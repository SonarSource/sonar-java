<p>OS commands are security-sensitive. For example, their use has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12465">CVE-2018-12465</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7187">CVE-2018-7187</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Applications that execute operating system commands or execute commands that interact with the underlying system should neutralize any
externally-provided input used to construct those commands. Failure to do so could allow an attacker to execute unexpected or dangerous commands,
potentially leading to loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> the executed command is constructed by input that is externally-influenced, for example, user input (attacker) (*) </li>
  <li> the command execution is not restricted to the right users (*) </li>
  <li> the application can be redesigned to not rely on external input to execute the command </li>
</ul>
<p>(*) You are at risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Restrict the control given to the user over the executed command:</p>
<ul>
  <li> make the executed command part of a whitelist and reject all commands not part of this list </li>
  <li> sanitize the user input </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Restrict which users can have access to the command</p>
<ul>
  <li> use a firewall to protect the process running the code, and to protect the network from the command </li>
  <li> authenticate the user and allow only some users to run the command </li>
</ul>
<p>Reduce the damage the command can do:</p>
<ul>
  <li> execute the code in a sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the operating system and the process. For example: a "jail"
  </li>
  <li> refuse to run the command if the process has too many privileges. For example: forbid running the code as "root" </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
