<p>Shared coding conventions make it possible to collaborate efficiently. This rule make it mandatory to place the open curly brace at the beginning of a line.</p>
<p>The following code snippet illustrates this rule:</p>
<pre>
public void myMethod 
{                                               //Compliant
  if(something)
  {                                             //Compliant
    executeTask();
  } else {                                    //Non-Compliant
    doSomethingElse();
  }
}
</pre>
