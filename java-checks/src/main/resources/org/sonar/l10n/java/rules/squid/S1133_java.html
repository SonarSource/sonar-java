<p>This rule is meant to be used as a way to track code which is marked as being deprecated. Deprecated code should eventually be removed.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
class Foo {
  /**
   * @deprecated
   */
  public void foo() {    // Noncompliant
  }

  @Deprecated            // Noncompliant
  public void bar() {
  }

  public void baz() {    // Compliant
  }
}
</pre>
