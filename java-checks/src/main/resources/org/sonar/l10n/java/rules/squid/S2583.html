<p>
Conditional statements using a condition which cannot be anything but FALSE have the effect of making blocks of code non-functional.
If the condition cannot evaluate to anything but TRUE, the conditional statement is completely redundant, and makes the code less readable.
</p>

<p>
It is quite likely that the code does not match the programmer's intent.
</p>

<p>
Either the condition should be removed or it should be updated so that it does not always evaluate to TRUE or FALSE.
</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>

<pre>
//foo can't be both equal and not equal to bar in the same expression
if( foo == bar &amp;&amp; something &amp;&amp; foo != bar) {...}

private void compute(int foo) {
  if ( foo == 4 ) {
    doSomething();
    // We know that foo is equal to 4 at this point and so the next condition is always false
    if ( foo &gt; 4 ) {...}
    ...
  }
  ...
}

private void compute(boolean foo) {
  if ( foo ) {
    return;
  }
  doSomething();
  // foo is always false here
  if ( foo ) {...}
  ...
}
</pre>
