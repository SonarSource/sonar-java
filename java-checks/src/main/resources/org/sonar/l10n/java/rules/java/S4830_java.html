<p>Validation of X.509 certificates is essential to create secure SSL/TLS sessions not vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. </p>
<p>The certificate chain validation includes these steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The certificate is issued by its parent Certificate Authority or the root CA trusted by the system. </li>
  <li> Each CA is allowed to issue certificates. </li>
  <li> Each certificate in the chain is not expired. </li>
</ul>
<p>This rule raises an issue when an implementation of X509TrustManager is not controlling the validity of the certificate (ie: no exception is
raised). Empty implementations of the <code>X509TrustManager</code> interface are often created to disable certificate validation. The correct
solution is to provide an appropriate trust store.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
class TrustAllManager implements X509TrustManager {

    @Override
    public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) throws CertificateException {  // Noncompliant, nothing means trust any client
    }

    @Override
    public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] x509Certificates, String s) throws CertificateException { // Noncompliant, this method never throws exception, it means trust any client
        LOG.log(Level.SEVERE, ERROR_MESSAGE);
    }

    @Override
    public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
        return null;
    }
}
</pre>
