<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>A <code>readObject</code> method is written when a <code>Serializable</code> object needs special handling to be rehydrated from file. It should be
the case that the object being created by <code>readObject</code> is only visible to the thread that invoked the method, and the
<code>synchronized</code> keyword is not needed, and using <code>synchronized</code> anyway is just confusing. If this is not the case, the method
should be refactored to make it the case.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
private synchronized void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream in)
     throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException { // Noncompliant
  //...
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream in)
     throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException { // Compliant
  //...
}
</pre>
