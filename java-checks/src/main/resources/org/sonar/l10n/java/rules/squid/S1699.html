<p>Calling an overridable method from a constructor could result in failures or strange behaviors when instantiating a subclass which overrides the method.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li> The subclass class constructor starts by contract by calling the parent class constructor.</li>
<li> The parent class constructor calls the method, which has been overridden in the child class.</li>
<li> If the behavior of the child class method depends on fields that are initialized in the child class constructor, unexpected behavior (like a <code>NullPointerException</code>) can result, because the fields aren't initialized yet.</li>
</ul>
