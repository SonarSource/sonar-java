<p>JUnit5 test classes and methods should generally have package visibility. To fix this issue, change their visibility to the default package
visibility.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>JUnit5 is more tolerant regarding the visibility of test classes and methods than JUnit4, which required everything to be <code>public</code>. Test
classes and methods can have any visibility except <code>private</code>. It is however recommended to use the default package visibility to improve
readability.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Test classes, test methods, and lifecycle methods are not required to be <code>public</code>, but they must not be <code>private</code>.</p>
  <p>It is generally recommended to omit the public modifier for test classes, test methods, and lifecycle methods unless there is a technical reason
  for doing so – for example, when a test class is extended by a test class in another package. Another technical reason for making classes and
  methods public is to simplify testing on the module path when using the Java Module System.</p>

<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>The code will be non-conventional and readability can be slightly affected.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>This rule does not raise an issue when the visibility is set to <code>private</code>, because <code>private</code> test methods and classes are
systematically ignored by JUnit5, without a proper warning. In this case, there is also an impact on reliability and so it is handled by the rule <a
href="https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/RSPEC-5810/">{rule:java:S5810}</a>.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>You can simply change the visibility by removing the <code>public</code> or <code>protected</code> keywords.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class MyClassTest { // Noncompliant - modifier can be removed
  @Test
  protected void test() { // Noncompliant - modifier can be removed
    // ...
  }
}
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class MyClassTest {
  @Test
  void test() {
    // ...
  }
}
</pre>
