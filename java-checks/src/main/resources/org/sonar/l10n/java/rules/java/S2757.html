<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The use of operators pairs ( <code>=+</code>, <code>=-</code> or <code>=!</code> ) where the reversed, single operator was meant (<code>+=</code>,
<code>-=</code> or <code>!=</code>) will compile and run, but not produce the expected results.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when <code>=+</code>, <code>=-</code>, or <code>=!</code> is used without any spacing between the two operators and when
there is at least one whitespace character after.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
int target = -5;
int num = 3;

target =- num;  // Noncompliant; target = -3. Is that really what's meant?
target =+ num; // Noncompliant; target = 3
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
int target = -5;
int num = 3;

target = -num;  // Compliant; intent to assign inverse value of num is clear
target += num;
</pre>
