<p>There are several reasons to use a group in a regular expression:</p>
<ul>
  <li> to change the precedence (e.g. <code>do(g|or)</code> will match 'dog' and 'door') </li>
  <li> to remember parenthesised part of the match in the case of capturing group </li>
  <li> to improve readability </li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, having an empty group is most probably a mistake. Either it is a leftover after refactoring and should be removed, or the actual
parentheses were intended and were not escaped.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
"foo()"  // Noncompliant, will match only 'foo'
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
"foo\\(\\)"  // Matches 'foo()'
</pre>
