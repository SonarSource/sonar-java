<p>Anonymous classes and lambdas (with Java 8) are a very convenient and compact way to inject a behavior without having to create a dedicated class.
But those anonymous inner classes and lambdas should be used only if the behavior to be injected can be defined in a few lines of code, otherwise the
source code can quickly become unreadable.</p>
