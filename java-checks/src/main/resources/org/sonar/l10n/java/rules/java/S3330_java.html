<p>When a cookie is configured with the <code>HttpOnly</code> attribute set to <em>true</em>, the browser guaranties that no client-side script will
be able to read it. In most cases, when a cookie is created, the default value of <code>HttpOnly</code> is <em>false</em> and it's up to the developer
to decide whether or not the content of the cookie can be read by the client-side script. As a majority of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks target
the theft of session-cookies, the <code>HttpOnly</code> attribute can help to reduce their impact as it won't be possible to exploit the XSS
vulnerability to steal session-cookies.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> the cookie is sensitive, used to authenticate the user, for instance a <em>session-cookie</em> </li>
  <li> the <code>HttpOnly</code> attribute offer an additional protection (not the case for an <em>XSRF-TOKEN cookie</em> / CSRF token for example)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You are at risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> By default the <code>HttpOnly</code> flag should be set to <em>true</em> for most of the cookies and it's mandatory for session /
  sensitive-security cookies. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Examples</h2>
<p>If you create a security-sensitive cookie in your JAVA code:</p>
<pre>
Cookie c = new Cookie(COOKIENAME, sensitivedata);
c.setHttpOnly(false);  // Sensitive: this sensitive cookie is created with the httponly flag set to false and so it can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability
</pre>
<p>By default the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html#setHttpOnly(boolean)"><code>HttpOnly</code></a> flag is
set to <em>false:</em></p>
<pre>
Cookie c = new Cookie(COOKIENAME, sensitivedata);  // Sensitive: this sensitive cookie is created with the httponly flag not defined (by default set to false) and so it can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Cookie c = new Cookie(COOKIENAME, sensitivedata);
c.setHttpOnly(true); // Compliant: this sensitive cookie is protected against theft (HttpOnly=true)
</pre>
