<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>If a <code>private</code> field is declared but not used locally, its limited visibility makes it dead code.</p>
<p>This is either a sign that some logic is missing or that the code should be cleaned.</p>
<p>Cleaning out dead code decreases the size of the maintained codebase, making it easier to understand and preventing bugs from being introduced.</p>
<pre>
public class MyClass {
  private int foo = 42; // Noncompliant: foo is unused and should be removed

  public int compute(int a) {
    return a * 42;
  }

}
</pre>
<p>Note that this rule does not take reflection into account, which means that issues will be raised on <code>private</code> fields that are only
accessed using the reflection API.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The rule admits 3 exceptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Serialization ID fields </li>
</ul>
<p>The Java serialization runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called <code>serialVersionUID</code>, which is used during
deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible for
serialization.</p>
<p>A serializable class can declare its own <code>serialVersionUID</code> explicitly by declaring a field named <code>serialVersionUID</code> that
must be static, final, and of type long. By definition, those <code>serialVersionUID</code> fields should not be reported by this rule:</p>
<pre>
public class MyClass implements java.io.Serializable {
  private static final long serialVersionUID = 42L;  // Compliant by exception
}
</pre>
<ul>
  <li> Annotated fields </li>
</ul>
<p>The unused field in this class will not be reported by the rule as it is annotated.</p>
<pre>
public class MyClass {
  @SomeAnnotation
  private int unused;  // Compliant by exception
}
</pre>
<ul>
  <li> Fields from classes with native methods </li>
</ul>
<p>The unused field in this class will not be reported by the rule as it might be used by native code.</p>
<pre>
public class MyClass {
  private int unused = 42;  // Compliant by exception
  private native static void doSomethingNative();
}
</pre>
