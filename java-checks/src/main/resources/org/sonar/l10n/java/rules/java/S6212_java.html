<p>In Java 10 <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286">Local-Variable Type Inference</a> was introduced. It allows you to omit the expected type of
a variable by declaring it with the <code>var</code> keyword. </p>
<p>While it is not always possible or cleaner to use this new way of declaring a variable, when the type on the left is the same as the one on the
right in an assignment, using the <code>var</code> will result in a more concise code.</p>
<p>This rule reports an issue when the expected type of the variable is the same as the returned type of assigned expression.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
var myClass = new MyClass();
</pre>
