SonarQube Java Custom Rules Plugin Template
=======

This example demonstrates how to write **Custom Rules** for SonarJava.

If you are using SonarQube 8.9 LTS (latest release), use the following command to build it without any dependency to the current project status:

```
mvn clean install -f pom_SQ_8_9_LTS
```

If you are using our previous SonarQube 7.9 LTS, use this one:

```
mvn clean install -f pom_SQ_7_9_LTS.xml
```

For more details about how to write custom rules, please refer to the official tutorial, [Writing Custom Java Rules 101](../CUSTOM_RULES_101.md).
