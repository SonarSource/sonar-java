                <p>
                    Nested tags &amp; supporting classes extend the base
                    Struts tags to allow them to relate to each other in a
                    nested nature.
                    The fundamental logic of the original tags doesn't change,
                    except in that all references to beans and bean properties
                    will be managed in a nested context.
