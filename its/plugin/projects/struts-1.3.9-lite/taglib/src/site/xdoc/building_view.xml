        <section name="How to Build View Components">


                <p>
                    This section focuses on the task of building the
                    <em>View</em>
                    components
                    for use with Struts.
                    Many applications rely on JavaServer Pages (JSP)
                    technology to create the
                    presentation layer.
                    The distribution includes a comprehensive JSP tag
                    library that
                    provides support for building internationalized
                    applications, as well as
                    for interacting with input forms.
                    Several other topics related to the View components are
                    briefly discussed.

            <subsection name="Internationalized Messages">

                <p>
                    A few years ago, application developers could count on
                    having to support
                    only residents of their own country, who are used to only
                    one (or
                    sometimes two) languages, and one way to represent numeric
                    quantities like
                    dates, numbers, and monetary values.
                    However, the explosion of application development based on
                    web
                    technologies, as well as the deployment of such
                    applications on the
                    Internet and other broadly accessible networks, have
                    rendered national
                    boundaries invisible in many cases.
                    This has translated (if you will pardon the pun) into a
                    need for
                    applications to support
                    <em>internationalization</em>
                    (often called "i18n"
                    because 18 is the number of letters in between the "i" and
                    the "n") and
                    <em>localization</em>
                    .
                </p>

                <p>
                    The framework builds upon the standard classes available on the
                    Java platform to
                    build internationalized and localized applications.
                    The key concepts to become familiar with are:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html">
                            <strong>Locale</strong>
                        </a>
                        - The fundamental Java class that supports
                        internationalization is
                        <code>Locale</code>
                        .
                        Each
                        <code>Locale</code>
                        represents a particular choice of country and
                        language (plus an optional language variant), and also
                        a set of
                        formatting assumptions for things like numbers and
                        dates.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html">
                            <strong>ResourceBundle</strong>
                        </a>
                        - The
                        <code>java.util.ResourceBundle</code>
                        class provides the fundamental tools for supporting
                        messages in
                        multiple languages.
                        See the Javadocs for the
                        <code>ResourceBundle</code>
                        class, and the
                        information on Internationalization in the
                        documentation bundle for your
                        JDK release, for more information.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/PropertyResourceBundle.html">
                            <strong>PropertyResourceBundle</strong>
                        </a>
                        - One of the standard
                        implementations of
                        <code>ResourceBundle</code>
                        allows you to define
                        resources using the same "name=value" syntax used to
                        initialize
                        properties files.
                        This is very convenient for preparing resource bundles
                        with messages
                        that are used in a web application, because these
                        messages are
                        generally text oriented.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html">
                            <strong>MessageFormat</strong>
                        </a>
                        - The
                        <code>java.text.MessageFormat</code>
                        class allows you to replace portions of a message
                        string (in this
                        case, one retrieved from a resource bundle) with
                        arguments specified
                        at run time.
                        This is useful in cases where you are creating a
                        sentence, but the
                        words would appear in a different order in different
                        languages.
                        The placeholder string
                        <code>{0}</code>
                        in the message is replaced by
                        the first runtime argument,
                        <code>{1}</code>
                        is replaced by the
                        second argument, and so on.

                    <li>
                        <a href="../struts-action/apidocs/org/apache/struts/util/MessageResources.html">
                            <strong>MessageResources</strong>
                        </a>
                        - The framework class
                        <code>org.apache.struts.util.MessageResources</code>
                        lets you treat
                        a set of resource bundles like a database, and allows
                        you to request
                        a particular message string for a particular Locale
                        (normally one
                        associated with the current user) instead of for the
                        default Locale
                        the server itself is running in.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    Please note that the i18n support in a framework like
                    Struts is limited to
                    the
                    <strong>presentation</strong>
                    of internationalized text and images to the user.
                    Support for Locale specific
                    <strong>input methods</strong>
                    (used with languages
                    such as Japanese, Chinese, and Korean) is left up to the
                    client device,
                    whichis usually a web browser.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For an internationalized application, follow the steps
                    described in
                    the Internationalization document in the JDK documentation
                    bundle for your
                    platform to create a properties file containing the
                    messages for each
                    language.
                    An example will illustrate this further:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Assume that your source code is created in package
                    <code>com.mycompany.mypackage</code>
                    , so it is stored in a directory
                    (relative to your source directory) named
                    <code>com/mycompany/mypackage</code>
                    .
                    To create a resource bundle called
                    <code>com.mycompany.mypackage.MyApplication</code>
                    , you would create the
                    following files in the
                    <code>com/mycompany/mypackage</code>
                    directory:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        <strong>MyApplication.properties</strong>
                        - Contains the messages in the default
                        language for your server.
                        If your default language is English, you might have an
                        entry like
                        this:
                        <code>prompt.hello=Hello</code>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>MyApplication_xx.properties</strong>
                        - Contains the same messages in the
                        language whose ISO language code is "xx" (See the
                        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html">
                            ResourceBundle Javadoc</a>
                        page for a link to the current list).
                        For a French version of the message shown above, you
                        would have this
                        entry:
                        <code>prompt.hello=Bonjour</code>
                        You can have resource bundle files for as many
                        languages as you need.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    When you configure the controller servlet in the web
                    application
                    deployment descriptor, one of the things you will need to
                    define in
                    an initialization parameter is the base name of the
                    resource bundle
                    for the application.
                    In the case described above, it would be
                    <code>com.mycompany.mypackage.MyApplication</code>
                    .
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[

                <p>
                    The important thing is for the resource bundle to be found
                    on the
                    class path for your application.
                    Another approach is to store the
                    <code>MyResources.properties</code>
                    file in your application's
                    <code>classes</code>
                    folder.
                    You can then simply specify "myResources" as the
                    application value.
                    Just be careful it is not deleted if your build script
                    deletes
                    classes as part of a "clean" target.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If it does, here is an Ant task to run when compiling your
                    application
                    that copies the contents of a
                    <code>src/conf</code>
                    directory to the
                    <code>classes</code>

            <subsection name="Forms and FormBean Interactions">

                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong>
                    While the examples given here use JSP and custom tags,
                    the ActionForm beans and the other controller
                    components are View neutral.
                    Struts can be used with Velocity Templates, XSL, and any
                    other presentation technology that can be rendered via a 
                    Java servlet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At one time or another, most web developers have built
                    forms using
                    the standard capabilities of HTML, such as the
                    <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>
                    tag.
                    Users have come to expect interactive applications to have
                    certain
                    behaviors, and one of these expectations relates to error
                    handling -- if
                    the user makes an error, the application should allow them
                    to fix just
                    what needs to be changed -- without having to re-enter any
                    of the rest
                    of the information on the current page or form.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fulfilling this expectation is tedious and cumbersome when
                    coding with
                    standard HTML and JSP pages.
                    For example, an input element for a
                    <code>username</code>
                    field might
                    look like this (in JSP):
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[
<input type="text" name="username"
value="<%= loginBean.getUsername() >"/>
]]></source>

                <p>
                    which is difficult to type correctly, confuses HTML
                    developers who are
                    not knowledgeable about programming concepts, and can
                    cause problems with
                    HTML editors.
                    Instead, Struts provides a comprehensive facility for
                    building forms,
                    based on the Custom Tag Library facility of JSP 1.1.
                    The case above would be rendered like this using Struts:
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[
<html:text property="username"/>;
]]></source>

                <p>
                    with no need to explicitly refer to the JavaBean from
                    which the initial
                    value is retrieved. That is handled automatically by the
                    JSP tag, using
                    facilities provided by the framework.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HTML forms are sometimes used to upload other files.
                    Most browsers support this through a &lt;input type="file"&gt;
                    element,
                    that generates a file browse button, but it's up to the
                    developer to
                    handle the incoming files.
                    Struts handles these "multipart" forms in a way identical
                    to building
                    normal forms.
                </p>

                <p>

                    form,

                <p>
                    Property references in JSP pages using the Struts
                    framework can reference
                    Java Bean properties as described in the JavaBeans
                    specification.
                    Most of these references refer to "scalar" bean
                    properties, referring to
                    primitive or single Object properties.
                    However, Struts, along with the Jakarta Commons Beanutils
                    library, allow
                    you to use property references which refer to individual
                    items in an array,
                    collection, or map, which are represented by bean methods
                    using
                    well-defined naming and signature schemes.

                <p>
                    In addition to the form and bean interactions described
                    above, the framework 
                    offers an additional facility to validate the input fields
                    it has received.
                    To utilize this feature, override the following method in
                    your ActionForm
                    class:
                </p>

                    The
                    <code>validate</code>
                    method is called by the controller servlet after
                    the bean properties have been populated, but before the
                    corresponding
                    action class's
                    <code>execute</code>
                    method is invoked.
                    The
                    <code>validate</code>
                    method has the following options:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        Perform the appropriate validations and find no

                        either
                        <code>null</code>
                        or a zero-length ActionErrors instance,
                        and the controller servlet will proceed to call the
                        <code>perform</code>
                        method of the appropriate
                        <code>Action</code>
                        class.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Perform the appropriate validations and find problems
                        -- Return an
                        ActionErrors instance containing
                        <code>ActionMessage</code>
                        's, which
                        are classes that contain the error message keys (into
                        the
                        application's
                        <code>MessageResources</code>
                        bundle) that should be
                        displayed.
                        The controller servlet will store this array as a
                        request attribute
                        suitable for use by the
                        <code>&lt;html:errors&gt;</code>
                        tag, and
                        will forward control back to the input form
                        (identified by the
                        <code>input</code>
                        property for this
                        <code>ActionMapping</code>
                        ).
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, this feature is entirely optional.
                    The default implementation of the
                    <code>validate</code>
                    method returns
                    <code>null</code>
                    , and the controller servlet will assume that any
                    required validation is done by the action class.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One common approach is to perform simple, prima facia
                    validations using
                    the ActionForm
                    <code>validate</code>
                    method, and then handle the
                    "business logic" validation from the Action.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Struts Validator, covered in the next section, may be
                    used to easily
                    validate ActionForms.

                    Struts
                    Taglibs, you should consider employing other techniques
                    that
                    will improve component reuse, reduce maintenance efforts,
                    and/or reduce
                    errors.
                    Several options are discussed in the following sections.

            <subsection name="Application-Specific Custom Tags">

                <p>
                    Beyond using the custom tags provided by the Struts JSP
                    tags, it is easy
                    to create tags that are specific to the application you
                    are building, to
                    assist in creating the user interface. The MailReader
                    example application
                    included with the distribution illustrates this
                    principle by creating
                    the following tags unique to the implementation of this
                    application:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>checkLogon</strong>
                        - Checks for the existence of a particular session
                        object, and forwards control to the logon page if it
                        is missing. This is
                        used to catch cases where a user has bookmarked a page
                        in the middle of
                        your application and tries to bypass logging on, or if
                        the user's session
                        has been timed out. (Note that there are better ways
                        to authenticate users; the
                        checkLogon tag is simply meant to demonstrate writing
                        your own custom tags.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>linkSubscription</strong>
                        - Generates a hyperlink to a details page
                        for a Subscription, which passes the required primary
                        key values as
                        request attributes. This is used when listing the
                        subscriptions associated
                        with a user, and providing links to edit or delete
                        them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>linkUser</strong>
                        - Generates a hyperlink to a details page
                        for a User, which passes the required primary key
                        values as
                        request attributes.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The source code for these tags is in the
                    <code>src/example</code>
                    directory,
                    in package
                    <code>org.apache.struts.example</code>
                    , along with the other Java
                    classes that are used in this application.

            <subsection name="Page Composition With Includes">

                <p>
                    Creating the entire presentation of a page in one JSP file
                    (with custom
                    tags and beans to access the required dynamic data) is a
                    very common
                    design approach, and was employed in the example
                    application included
                    with the distribution.
                    However, many applications require the display of multiple
                    logically
                    distinct portions of your application together on a single
                    page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, a portal application might have some or all
                    of the following
                    functional capabilities available on the portal's "home"
                    page:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        Access to a search engine for this portal.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        One or more "news feed" displays, with the topics of
                        interest
                        customizedfrom the user's registration profile.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Access to discussion topics related to this portal.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A "mail waiting" indicator if your portal provides
                        free email
                        accounts.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    The development of the various segments of this site is
                    easier if you
                    can divide up the work, and assign different developers to
                    the different
                    segments.
                    Then, you can use the
                    <em>include</em>
                    capability of JavaServer Pages
                    technology to combine the results into a single result
                    page, or use the
                    include tag provided with the framework.
                    There are three types of
                    <em>include</em>
                    available, depending on when you w
                    ant the combination of output to occur:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        An
                        <code>&lt;%@ include file="xxxxx" %&gt;</code>
                        directive can
                        include a file that contains Java code or JSP tags.
                        The code in the included file can even reference
                        variables declared
                        earlier in the outer jsp page.
                        The code is inlined into the other JavaServer Page
                        before it is
                        compiled so it can definitely contain more than just
                        HTML.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The include
                        <em>action</em>
                        (
                        <code>&lt;jsp:include page="xxxxx"
                            flush="true" /&gt;</code>
                        ) is processed at request time, and is
                        handled transparently by the server.
                        Among other things, that means you can conditionally
                        perform the
                        include by nesting it within a tag like
                        <a href="struts-logic.html#equal">equal</a>
                        by using it's
                        parameter attribute.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The
                        <a href="struts-bean.html#include">bean:include</a>
                        tag takes either a an argument "forward" representing
                        a logical name
                        mapped to the jsp to include, or the "id" argument,
                        which represents a
                        page context String variable to print out to the jsp
                        page.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    Tiles is a powerful templating library that allows you to
                    construct views
                    by combining various "tiles".
                    Here's a quick setup guide:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Create a /layout/layout.jsp file that contains your
                        app's common look and
                        feel:

                        <source><![CDATA[
<html>
<body>
<tiles:insert attribute="body"/>
</body>
</html>
]]></source>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Create your /index.jsp homepage file:

                        <source><![CDATA[
<h1>This is my homepage</h1>
]]></source>

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Create a /WEB-INF/tiles-defs.xml file that looks like
                        this:

                        <source><![CDATA[
<tiles-definitions>
<definition 
    name="layout" 
    path="/layout/layout.jsp">
    <put name="body" value=""/>
</definition>
<definition name="homepage" extends="layout">
    <put 
        name="body" 
        value="/index.jsp"/>
</definition>
<tiles-definitions>
]]></source>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Setup the TilesPlugin in the struts-config.xml file:

                        <source><![CDATA[
<plug-in 
    className="org.apache.struts.tiles.TilesPlugin">
    <set-property 
        property="definitions-config" 
        value="/WEB-INF/tiles-defs.xml"/>
</plug-in>
]]></source>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Setup an action mapping in struts-config.xml to point
                        to your
                        homepage tile:

                        <source><![CDATA[
<action 
path="/index"
type="org.apache.struts.actions.ForwardAction"
parameter="homepage"/>
]]></source>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    The TilesPlugin configures a special RequestProcessor that
                    determines
                    if the requested view is a tile and processes it
                    accordingly.
                    Note that we made the homepage tile extend our root layout
                    tile and
                    changed the body attribute.
                    Tiles inserts the file named in the body attribute into
                    the main
                    layout.
                </p>

                <p>
                    See the tiles-documentation webapp for in-depth examples.
                </p>
