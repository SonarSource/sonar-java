      <section name="Welcome to Struts Taglib">
          <p>
            The Struts Taglib component provides a set of JSP custom tag 
            libraries that help developers create interactive form-based 
            applications.
            There are tags to help with everything from displaying error 
            messages to dealing with nested ActionForm beans.  
          </p>
            
          <p>
            Struts Taglib is composed of four distinct tag libraries: 
            Bean, HTML, Logic, and Nested. 
          </p>
                    <table>
            <tr>
                <th> 
                <a href="dev_bean.html">Bean</a>
                </th>
                <td>
                 The bean tags are  useful in defining new beans (in 
                 any scope) from a variety of possible sources, as well 
                 as a tag to render  a particular bean (or bean property) 
                 to the output response.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
            <tr>
                <th> 
                <a href="dev_html.html">HTML</a>
                </th>
                <td>
                 The HTML tags are used to create input forms, 
                 as well as other tags generally useful in the creation of
                 HTML-based user interfaces. 
                 The output is HTML 4.01 compliant or XHTML 1.0 when in 
                 XHTML mode.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
            <tr>
                <th> 
                <a href="dev_logic.html">Logic</a>
                </th>
                <td>
                 The Logic tags that are useful in managing conditional 
                 generation of output text, looping
                 over object collections for repetitive generation of output 
                 text, and application flow management
                            </td>
                        </tr>
            <tr>
                <th> 
                <a href="dev_nested.html">Nested</a>
                </th>
                <td>
                 The Nested tags extend the base Struts tags to allow 
                 them to relate to each other in a nested nature. 
                 The fundamental logic of the original tags doesn't change, 
                 except in that all references to beans and bean properties 
                 will be managed in a nested context.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        </table>
