                    The tags in the Struts HTML library form a bridge between
                    a JSP view and the other components of a Web application.
                    Since a dynamic Web application often depends on gathering
                    data from a user, input forms play an important role in
                    the Struts. Consequently, the majority of the
                    HTML tags involve HTML forms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The HTML taglib contains tags used to create input
                    forms, as well as other tags generally useful
                    in the creation of HTML-based user interfaces. The output
                    is HTML 4.01 compliant or XHTML 1.0 when in XHTML mode.
