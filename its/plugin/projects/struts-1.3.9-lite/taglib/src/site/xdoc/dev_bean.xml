                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong>
                    - Some of the features in this taglib are also
                    available in the
                    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/jstl/">
                        JavaServer Pages
                        Standard Tag Library (JSTL).</a>
                    The Apache Struts group encourages the use of the standard tags
                    over the Struts
                    specific tags when possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The "struts-bean" tag library contains JSP custom tags
                    useful in defining
                    new beans (in any desired scope) from a variety of
                    possible sources,
                    as well as a tag to render a particular bean (or bean
                    property) to the
                    output response.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This tag library contains tags useful in accessing beans
                    and their
                    properties, as well as defining new beans (based on these
                    accesses) that
                    are accessible to the remainder of the page via scripting
                    variables and
                    page scope attributes.
                    Convenient mechanisms to create new beans based on the
                    value of request
                    cookies, headers, and parameters are also provided.
