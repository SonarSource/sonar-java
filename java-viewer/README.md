SonarJava Viewer
----------------

This module is used to visualize in a graphical way various outputs generated by the SonarJava plugin, when analyzing source code:

* Exploded Graph (output of the symbolic execution engine)
* Control Flow Graph
* Syntax Tree

Usage
--------

To start the viewer (web app), you have two options:

* execute `main` method from `org.sonar.java.viewer.Viewer` class;
* build and run the web app using command line `mvn exec:java`.

Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9999`. Note that default port (`9999`) is currently hardcoded.
