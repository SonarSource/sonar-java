<p>If the denominator to an integer division or remainder operation is zero, a <code>ArithmeticException</code> is thrown.</p>
<p>This error will crash your program in most cases. To fix it, you need to ensure that the denominator value in all division operations is always
non-zero, or check the value against zero before performing the division.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>A division (<code>/</code>) or remainder operation (<code>%</code>) by zero indicates a bug or logical error. This is because in Java, a division
or remainder operation where the denominator is zero and not a floating point value always results in an <code>ArithmeticException</code> being
thrown.</p>
<p>When working with <code>double</code> or <code>float</code> values, no exception will be thrown, but the operation will result in special floating
point values representing either positive infinity, negative infinity, or <code>NaN</code>. Unless these special values are explicitly handled by a
program, zero denominators should be avoided in floating point operations, too. Otherwise, the application might produce unexpected results.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Issues of this type interrupt the normal execution of a program, causing it to crash or putting it into an inconsistent state. Therefore, this
issue might impact the availability and reliability of your application, or even result in data loss.</p>
<p>If the computation of the denominator is tied to user input data, this issue can potentially even be exploited by attackers to disrupt your
application.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
void test_divide() {
  int z = 0;
  if (unknown()) {
    // ..
    z = 3;
  } else {
    // ..
  }
  z = 1 / z; // Noncompliant, possible division by zero
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
void test_divide() {
  int z = 0;
  if (unknown()) {
    // ..
    z = 3;
  } else {
    // ..
    z = 1;
  }
  z = 1 / z;
}
</pre>
