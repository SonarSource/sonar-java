<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Leaking resources in an application is never a good idea, as it can lead to memory issues, and even the crash of the application. This rule
template allows you to specify which constructions open a resource and how it is closed in order to raise issue within a method scope when custom
resources are leaked.</p>
