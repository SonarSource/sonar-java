/**
 * This interface defines how to use checks (rules) verifiers. It's goal is to provide all the required information
 * to the analyzer to verify checks' expected behavior.
 * <p>
 * The starting point to define a verifier is {@link #newVerifier()}. Then, configuration can be specified.
 * <p>
 * It is required to provide to the verifier at least the following:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A rule, by calling {@link #withCheck(JavaFileScanner)}, or {@link #withChecks(JavaFileScanner...)}</li>
 *   <li>A test file, by calling {@link #onFile(String)}, {@link #onFiles(String...)}, or {@link #onFiles(Collection)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * Methods starting with "verify..." (e.g {@link #verifyIssues()} ) are the methods which effectively validate the rule.
 * It is required to call any of them at the end of the verifier's configuration in order to trigger the verification.
 * <strong>Nothing will happen if one of these method is not called.</strong>
 * <p>
 * In the test file(s), lines on which it is expected to have issues being raised have to be flagged with a comment
 * prefixed by the "Noncompliant" string, followed by some optional details/specificity of the expected issue.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to specify the absolute line number on which the issue should appear by appending {@literal "@<line>"} to "Noncompliant".
 * But it is usually better to use line number relative to the current, this is possible to do by prefixing the number with either '+' or '-'.
 * <p>
 * For example, the following comment says that an issue is going to be raised on the next line (@+1), with the given message:
 * <pre>
 *   // Noncompliant@+1 {{do not import "java.util.List"}}
 *   import java.util.List;
 * </pre>
 * Full syntax:
 * <pre>
 *   // Noncompliant@+1 [[startColumn=1;endLine=+1;endColumn=2;effortToFix=4;secondary=3,4]] {{issue message}}
 * </pre>
 * Some attributes can also be written using a simplified form, for instance:
 * <pre>
 *   // Noncompliant [[sc=14;ec=42]] {{issue message}}
 * </pre>
 * Finally, note that attributes between {@literal [[...]]} are all optional:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>startColumn (sc): column where the highlight starts</li>
 *   <li>endLine (el): relative endLine where the highlight ends (i.e. +1), same line if omitted</li>
 *   <li>endColumn (ec): column where the highlight ends</li>
 *   <li>effortToFix: the cost to fix as integer</li>
 *   <li>secondary: a comma separated list of integers identifying the lines of secondary locations if any</li>
 * </ul>
