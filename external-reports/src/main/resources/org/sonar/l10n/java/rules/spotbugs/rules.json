This is due to the fact that regex engines \n    may take a large amount of time when analyzing certain strings, depending on how the regex is defined.\n<p>\n    For example, for the regex: <b>^(a+)+$</b>, the input \"<code>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaX</code>\" will cause the regex engine to analyze 65536 \ndifferent paths.<sup>[1] Example taken from OWASP references</sup></p>\n<p>\nTherefore, it is possible that a single request may cause a large amount of computation on the server side. \nThe problem with this regex, and others like it, is that there are two different ways the same input character can be accepted by the \nRegex due to the + (or a *) inside the parenthesis, and the + (or a *) outside the parenthesis. The way this is written, either + could \nconsume the character 'a'. To fix this, the regex should be rewritten to eliminate the ambiguity. For example, this could simply be \nrewritten as: <b>^a+$</b>, which is presumably what the author meant anyway (any number of a's). Assuming that's what the original \nregex meant, this new regex can be evaluated quickly, and is not subject to ReDOS.\n</p>\n<br/>\n<p>\n<b>References</b><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.jroller.com/sebastianKuebeck/entry/detecting_and_preventing_redos_vulnerabilities\">Sebastian Kubeck's Weblog: Detecting and Preventing ReDoS Vulnerabilities</a><br/>\n<sup>[1]</sup> <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS\">OWASP: Regular expression Denial of Service</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html\">CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')</a>\n</p>",
