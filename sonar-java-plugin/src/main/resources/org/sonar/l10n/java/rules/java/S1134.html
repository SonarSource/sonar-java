<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p><code>FIXME</code> tags are commonly used to mark places where a bug is suspected, but which the developer wants to deal with later.</p>
<p>Sometimes the developer will not have the time or will simply forget to get back to that tag.</p>
<p>This rule is meant to track those tags and to ensure that they do not go unnoticed.</p>
<pre>
int divide(int numerator, int denominator) {
  return numerator / denominator;              // FIXME denominator value might be  0
}
</pre>
