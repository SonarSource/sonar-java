<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>An empty code block is confusing. It will require some effort from maintainers to determine if it is intentional or indicates the implementation is
incomplete.</p>
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 42; i++){}  // Noncompliant: is the block empty on purpose, or is code missing?
</pre>
<p>Removing or filling the empty code blocks takes away ambiguity and generally results in a more straightforward and less surprising code.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The rule ignores code blocks that contain comments unless they are <code>synchronized</code> blocks because these can affect program flow.</p>
