<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>It is a good practice to isolate test classes in a separate package so that what is shipped to production is neither polluted by nor bloated with
them. Further, including unit tests in code assemblies could affect build processes.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when test classes are found in projects containing non-test-related code.</p>
