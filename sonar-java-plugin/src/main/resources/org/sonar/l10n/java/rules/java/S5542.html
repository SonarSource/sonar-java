<p>This vulnerability exposes encrypted data to a number of attacks whose goal is to recover the plaintext.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Encryption algorithms are essential for protecting sensitive information and ensuring secure communications in a variety of domains. They are used
for several important reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Confidentiality, privacy, and intellectual property protection </li>
  <li> Security during transmission or on storage devices </li>
  <li> Data integrity, general trust, and authentication </li>
</ul>
<p>When selecting encryption algorithms, tools, or combinations, you should also consider two things:</p>
<ol>
  <li> No encryption is unbreakable. </li>
  <li> The strength of an encryption algorithm is usually measured by the effort required to crack it within a reasonable time frame. </li>
</ol>
<p>For these reasons, as soon as cryptography is included in a project, it is important to choose encryption algorithms that are considered strong and
secure by the cryptography community.</p>
<p>For AES, the weakest modes are CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) and ECB (Electronic Codebook) because they are either vulnerable to padding oracles or
do not provide authentication mechanisms.</p>
<p>For RSA, the weakest algorithms are either using it without padding or using the PKCS1v1.5 padding scheme.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>The cleartext of an encrypted message might be recoverable. Additionally, it might be possible to modify the cleartext of an encrypted message.</p>
<p>Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate possible impacts of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability.</p>
<h4>Theft of sensitive data</h4>
<p>The encrypted message might contain data that is considered sensitive and should not be known to third parties.</p>
<p>By using a weak algorithm the likelihood that an attacker might be able to recover the cleartext drastically increases.</p>
<h4>Additional attack surface</h4>
<p>By modifying the cleartext of the encrypted message it might be possible for an attacker to trigger other vulnerabilities in the code. Encrypted
values are often considered trusted, since under normal circumstances it would not be possible for a third party to modify them.</p>
