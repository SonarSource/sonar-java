<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>If an exception is already being thrown within the <code>try</code> block or caught in a <code>catch</code> block, throwing another exception in
the <code>finally</code> block will override the original exception. This means that the original exceptionâ€™s message and stack trace will be lost,
potentially making it challenging to diagnose and troubleshoot the root cause of the problem.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
try {
  /* some work which end up throwing an exception */
  throw new IllegalArgumentException();
} finally {
  /* clean up */
  throw new RuntimeException();       // Noncompliant; masks the IllegalArgumentException
}
</pre>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
