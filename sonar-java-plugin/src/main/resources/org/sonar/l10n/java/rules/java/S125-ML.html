<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Commented-out code distracts the focus from the actual executed code. It creates a noise that increases maintenance code. And because it is never
executed, it quickly becomes out of date and invalid.</p>
<p>Commented-out code should be deleted and can be retrieved from source control history if required.</p>
