<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>A method that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities. Such method inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder
to maintain.</p>
<p>Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller methods which focus on well-defined tasks. Those smaller methods will
not only be easier to understand, but also probably easier to test.</p>
