<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>There is no good reason to declare a field "public" and "static" without also declaring it "final". Most of the time this is a kludge to share a
state among several objects. But with this approach, any object can do whatever it wants with the shared state, such as setting it to
<code>null</code>.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
public class Greeter {
  public static Foo foo = new Foo();
  ...
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
public class Greeter {
  public static final Foo FOO = new Foo();
  ...
}
</pre>
