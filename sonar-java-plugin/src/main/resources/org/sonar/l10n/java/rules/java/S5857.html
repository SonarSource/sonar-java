<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Using reluctant quantifiers (also known as lazy or non-greedy quantifiers) in patterns can often lead to needless backtracking, making the regex
needlessly inefficient and potentially vulnerable to <a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/catastrophic.html">catastrophic backtracking</a>.
Particularly when using <code>.*?</code> or <code>.+?</code> to match anything up to some terminating character, it is usually a better idea to
instead use a greedily or possessively quantified negated character class containing the terminating character. For example <code>&lt;.+?&gt;</code>
should be replaced with <code>&lt;[^&gt;]++&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
&lt;.+?&gt;
".*?"
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
&lt;[^&gt;]++&gt;
"[^"]*+"
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
&lt;[^&gt;]+&gt;
"[^"]*"
</pre>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>This rule only applies in cases where the reluctant quantifier can easily be replaced with a negated character class. That means the repetition has
to be terminated by a single character or character class. Patterns such as the following, where the alternatives without reluctant quantifiers are
more complicated, are therefore not subject to this rule:</p>
<pre>
&lt;!--.*?--&gt;
/\*.*?\*/
</pre>
