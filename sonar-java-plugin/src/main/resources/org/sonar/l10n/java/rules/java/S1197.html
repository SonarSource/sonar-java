<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Array designators should always be located on the type for better code readability. Otherwise, developers must look both at the type and the
variable name to know whether or not a variable is an array.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
int matrix[][];   // Noncompliant
int[] matrix[];   // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
int[][] matrix;   // Compliant
</pre>
