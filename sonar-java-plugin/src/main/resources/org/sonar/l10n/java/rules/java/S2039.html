<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Failing to explicitly declare the visibility of a member variable could result it in having a visibility you donâ€™t expect, and potentially leave it
open to unexpected modification by other classes.</p>
<p>The default access level modifier may be intentional; in that case, this rule can report false positives.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
class Ball {
  String color = "red";  // Noncompliant
}
enum A {
  B;
  int a;  // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
class Ball {
  private String color = "red";  // Compliant
}
enum A {
  B;
  private int a;  // Compliant
}
</pre>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Members with comments containing the word <code>modifier</code> are ignored, as it indicates the modifier is intentionally omitted. </li>
  <li> Members annotated with the <code>@VisibleForTesting</code> annotation are ignored, as it indicates that visibility has been purposely relaxed
  to make the code testable. </li>
</ul>
<pre>
class Cone {
  @VisibleForTesting
  Logger logger; // Compliant
}
</pre>
