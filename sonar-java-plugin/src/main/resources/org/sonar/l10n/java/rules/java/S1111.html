<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Before it reclaims storage from an object that is no longer referenced, the garbage collector calls <code>finalize()</code> on the object.</p>
<p>This is a good time to release resources held by the object.</p>
<p>Because the general contract is that the <code>finalize</code> method should only be called once per object, calling this method explicitly is
misleading and does not respect this contract.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>An explicit call to an objectâ€™s finalize method will perform operations that most likely were supposed to be performed only when the object was not
referenced anymore by any thread.</p>
<p>Since it is an acceptable practice to override the finalize method in any subclass of <code>Object</code>, by invoking it explicitly, we will run
code that was designed to only be ran at a different time.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
public void dispose() throws Throwable {
  this.finalize();                       // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
